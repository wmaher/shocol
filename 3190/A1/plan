change from integer to character because f95 better
format with label, ew
if statements changed from .EQ, easier to read
Use ICHAR to compare
Letters I - L are integers

Look at what the problem is and try to identify the steps at certain parts.

1. Read Source String character by character
2a. If character is an operand, put it in polish stack, iterate polish index
2b. If it's an operator AND it's precedence is higher, put in OPSTCK
2c. If it's an operator AND it's precedence IS NOT higher, empty OPSTCK, continue
2d. If it's a RIGHT BRACKET, empty the OPSTCK
